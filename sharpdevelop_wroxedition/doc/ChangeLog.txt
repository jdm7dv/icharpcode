		Refactored the syntax highlighting
	</change>
	
	<change author="Andrea Paatz" date = "09/12/2002">
		Implemented the KMP searching algorithm. KMP was choosen instead of boyer moore and other alternatives because
		the others must initialize the alphabet which would be 65536 chars. (maybe after the next unicode spec over 4000000000)
		Even if they are faster the initialization penalaty seems too high and KMP is fast enough (much faster than the old brute
		force strategy).
	</change>
	
	<change author="Mike Krueger" date = "09/12/2002">
		Fixed a bug in the replace all. (not all patterns were replaced sometimes)

	</change>
	
	<change author="Mike Krueger" date = "09/12/2002">
		Completed the ObservedSave functions
	</change>
	
	<change author="Mike Krueger" date = "09/11/2002">
		Fixed the bug with the conversion of old prjx files that may mess up the .cmbx file.
		
		I've seen that it may be a deeper problem with files that are saved by SharpDevelop because 
		SharpDevelop assumed almost always that it had write permission or that it has write permission
		but that the write did ok. (In some cases 'inform' messageboxes were shown) 
		
		I've introduced new functionality to the IFileService to solve this problem :
		
		2 enums : 
		
		public enum SaveFilePolicy {
			Inform,
			ProvideAlternative
		}
		
		public enum SaveFileResult {
			OK,
			Failed,
			SavedAlternatively
		}
	
		2 delegates:
		public delegate void SaveFileDelegate();
		public delegate void SaveFileAsDelegate(string saveFile);
		
		A whole bunch of functions:
		
		SaveFileResult ObservedSave(SaveFileDelegate saveFile, string fileName);
		SaveFileResult ObservedSave(SaveFileDelegate saveFile, string fileName, SaveFilePolicy policy);
		SaveFileResult ObservedSave(SaveFileDelegate saveFile, string fileName, string messsage, SaveFilePolicy policy);
		
		SaveFileResult ObservedSave(SaveFileAsDelegate saveFileAs, string fileName);
		SaveFileResult ObservedSave(SaveFileAsDelegate saveFileAs, string fileName, SaveFilePolicy policy);
		SaveFileResult ObservedSave(SaveFileAsDelegate saveFileAs, string fileName, string message, SaveFilePolicy policy);
		
		SaveFileResult ObservedSave(XmlDocument doc, string fileName);
		SaveFileResult ObservedSave(XmlDocument doc, string fileName, SaveFilePolicy policy);	
		SaveFileResult ObservedSave(XmlDocument doc, string fileName, string message, SaveFilePolicy policy);	
		
		First : Do not use them inside view content save/save as methods because the view content save/save as methods
		        are observed at the command level. Generally put the obeservedsave at a single point. 
		        Example: The view are many but the save method is only called in the command therefore it should be put into the command.
		                 The project class has one save method which is called in many occaisons (propably, but it is more than one) therefore
		                 it should be observed in the project class itself.
		        
		These functions check the save if it throws an exception an depending on the SaveFilePolicy it does:
			+ Inform the User with a message box about the file (location) and gives a short description about the reason
			  (check write permission)
			+ Or displays a box that has retry/ignore/choose different location buttons and the user can choose what he wishes
			  to do. 
			  
		The SaveFileResult is the canonical result of this mess :)
		
		If no message is given a default message will be displayed. If you specify your own message you have following properties :
	
			{"FileName", fileName},
			{"Path",     Path.GetDirectoryName(fileName)},
			{"FileNameWithoutPath", Path.GetFileName(fileName)},
			{"Exception", exceptionGot.GetType().FullName},
		
		Note that the ObservedSave with the SaveFileDelegate can't handle the ProvideAlternative as the other services
		in this case it shows only retry / ignoe. That is because it gets no function that it could give the file name.
		Therefore this function can only return OK or Failed and never returns SavedAlternatively.
		
		Note the ObservedSave routine doesn't check if the fileName is valid. It is recommended that only valid names get used.
		(see IsFileNameValid method in the FileUtility class)
		
		It is recommended to use this functions for ANY save operation inside SharpDevelop. If not I'll personally check the 
		save routine you write :)
		
		btw. I've checked the whole code and now it should always use 'safe' writes.
