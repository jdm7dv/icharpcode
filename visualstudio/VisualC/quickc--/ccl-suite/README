To install the test suite generator, all you should have to do is type 

	./install

This will create the call-test script and the test.settings file. You will
need to modify the test.settings file to include the path of any compilers
that you wish to test. 

After doing that, you should be able to just type

	call-test

to start testing process.

This implementation does require that you have a version of perl available on 
the machine. Also, because we ship compiler Icon code, we have also included
the iconx interpreter. The Icon translator and interpreter are available
from the University of Arizona at ftp.cs.arizona.edu.

This software is still very experimental. If you have any problems, please send
mail to Mark Bailey at

	bailey@virginia.edu

and I'll try to fix the problems you have.

Currently the ANSI C descriptions for the SPARC and the M68020 are not 
complete--so you won't be able to test several of the ANSI C argument datatypes
with this release of the software.
