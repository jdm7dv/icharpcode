Converter:

Known limitations and bugs:
- Web UI does not report syntax errors
- Comments are not converted
- Preprocessor directives are not converted

We probably cannot convert all preprocessor directives exactly without changing the semantics.

Missing features and bugs:
C# to VB:
- unsafe code cannot be converted

VB to C#:
- statements:
	* special select case expressions
	* special statements: call, erase, redim, a.o.
- expressions:
	* .. To .. arguments
	* anonymous types
- special cases:
    * Should add Public Modifier to inner types, methods, properties and fields in structures
	* Built-in methods => Prefix with class name
    * Function A() \n A = SomeValue \n End Function -> convert to return statement
    * Comparison with empty string literal -> string.IsNullOrEmpty
    * Add default value to local variable declarations without initializer
    * XML literals -> XLinq
